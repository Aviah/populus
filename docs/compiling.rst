Compiling
=========

Running ``$ populus compile`` will compile all of the project contracts found
in the ``./contracts/`` directory.  The compiled assets are then written to
``./build/contracts.json``.

.. note::

    Populus currently only supports compilation of Solidity contracts.


Basic Compilation
-----------------

Basic usage to compile all of the contracts and libraries in your project can
be done as follows.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ populus compile
    ============ Compiling ==============
    > Loading source files from: ./contracts

    > Found 1 contract source files
    - contracts/Greeter.sol

    > Compiled 1 contracts
    - Greeter

    > Wrote compiled assets to: ./build/contracts.json


Watching
--------

This command can be used with the flag ``--watch/-w`` which will automatically
recompile your contracts when the source code changes.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ populus compile --watch
    ============ Compiling ==============
    > Loading source files from: ./contracts

    > Found 1 contract source files
    - contracts/Greeter.sol

    > Compiled 1 contracts
    - Greeter

    > Wrote compiled assets to: ./build/contracts.json
    Change detected in: contracts/Greeter.sol
    ============ Compiling ==============
    > Loading source files from: ./contracts

    > Found 1 contract source files
    - contracts/Greeter.sol

    > Compiled 1 contracts
    - Greeter

    > Wrote compiled assets to: ./build/contracts.json


Build Output
------------

Output is serialized as ``JSON`` and written to ``build/contracts.json``
relative to the root of your project.  It will be a mapping of your contract
names to the compiled assets for that contract.
